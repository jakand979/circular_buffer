# circular_buffer
Simple circular buffer project in C.

Circular buffer is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end. 
This structure lends itself easily to buffering data streams.
There were early circular buffer implementations in hardware (for example in keyboard).

Files in project:
- main.c - demonstration of buffer functionality
- circular_buffer.c - function definitions
- circular_buffer.h - function and structure declarations header file
