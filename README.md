# circular_buffer

**Circular buffer** is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end. 
This structure lends itself easily to buffering data streams.
There were early circular buffer implementations in hardware (keyboard buffer) or for example in oscilloscope.

Project structure:
- **main.c** - console demo of buffer functionality
- **circular_buffer.c** - helper functions definitions
- **circular_buffer.h** - main structure and helper functions declarations
