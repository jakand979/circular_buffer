# circular_buffer
Simple circular buffer project in C.

**Circular buffer** is a data structure that uses a single, fixed-size buffer as if it were connected end-to-end. 
This structure lends itself easily to buffering data streams.
There were early circular buffer implementations in hardware (keyboard buffer) or for example in oscilloscope.

Files in project:
- **main.c** - console demo of buffer functionality
- **circular_buffer.c** - helper functions definitions
- **circular_buffer.h** - main structure and helper functions declarations

You can test this program by cloning it to your chosen directory with command: **git clone https://github.com/jakand979/circular_buffer.git**
